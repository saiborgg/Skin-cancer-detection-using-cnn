This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify skin cancer images as either benign or malignant. The dataset used was the Melanoma Cancer Dataset from Kaggle, which was organized into training and testing sets. To enhance model generalization, data augmentation techniques such as rotation, shifting, zooming, shearing, and flipping were applied using the ImageDataGenerator. The CNN architecture consists of multiple convolutional and max-pooling layers followed by fully connected dense layers, with a final sigmoid activation for binary classification. The model was trained using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function, with EarlyStopping and ReduceLROnPlateau callbacks to prevent overfitting and optimize learning rate scheduling. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices, with visualization through Seaborn and Matplotlib. This end-to-end pipeline demonstrates how deep learning can be effectively applied in the medical imaging domain to support early detection of melanoma.
